# Camera Calibration

Final project of the course of Computer Vision of the MSc in Data Science and Scientific Computing at the University of Trieste.

- `Calibration.mlx`: a Matlab live editor file containing the implementation details and comments regarding the calibration of a camera using the Zhang procedure on the set of images contained in the folder 'images'. The file can be executed in blocks to obtain the results which are reported in the file 'report.pdf' in the section 'Camera calibration'.
- `myCalibration.mlx`: a Matlab live editor file containing an analogous implementation used for calibrating the camera of my own smartphone. The images used are stored in the directory 'my_images' along with the checkerboard used for taking the pictures. This file can be executed to reproduce the results reported in 'report.pdf' in the section 'Smartphone Camera Calibration'.

In the directory 'RadialDistortionCompensation' is reported an implementation of the calibration procedure compensating for radial distortion.
